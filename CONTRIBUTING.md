# Contributing

Thanks for offering your help! Here's how you contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Do your work in that fork
3. Submit a pull request

After you submit a pull request, we will review it and suggest changes and improvements. Then, we'll merge it into
our repository and the changes will immediately go live.

The easiest way to find work to do is by looking at the [pr-wanted](https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush/issues?labels=pr-wanted&page=1&state=open) label.
If you start working on something, comment on the issue so other contributors can know someone is already working on it.
