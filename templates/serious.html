    <h1>Serious Stuff</h1>
    <p>This page is somewhat wordy, but we attempted to make it easy to read. We want to be as open as possible about what we're doing
    here. If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@mediacru.sh">contact us</a>.</p>
    <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
    <p>We can and will ban you if you fail to follow these terms. We may also take legal action against more serious violations.</p>
    <p>The general idea is "be responsible". Follow these basic rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not upload anything that is illegal for us to host in the United States.</li>
        <li>Do not upload anything you might regret uploading. We rarely remove uploads that don't violate the terms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you see illegal content, please press "report" on the page the content appears on.</p>
    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>There is only one metric we gather about you that you are not able to turn off, which is your hashed IP address. When you upload
    an image, we run your IP address through a hashing function and store it in our database. Once hashed, it is infeasible to recover
    the IP address, so your IP address is safe, even if our database is compromised. We couldn't share it even if we wanted to.</p>
    <p>This means that if for some reason our database were stolen or we were pressured by anyone to release information about you, we
    are unable to. However, it allows us to ban malicous users from using the site. What we can do is determine if a hash matches a given
    IP address, so we can use it as a basis for banning an anonymous user. For the technically savvy, we run IPs through bcrypt with 12
    rounds.</p>
    <p>There is some other data we gather about you that you <em>are</em> able to turn off. We gather anonymous information about
    our users via Google Analytics. This data includes (but is not limited to):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your country of origin</li>
        <li>Your browser and operating sytem</li>
        <li>The website you used to get here (i.e. Reddit, Google, etc)</li>
        <li>Your preferred language</li>
        <li>Your Internet Service Provider</li>
        <li>The amount of time you spent on the site and which pages you were on</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Again, this data is collected anonymously and we compare it with everyone else on the site - we never snoop on you individually.
    MediaCrush respects your Do Not Track settings. If you do not want this information gathered about you, you can turn on Do Not Track
    in your web browser. Instructions may be found <a href="http://donottrack.us/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>We publish the data collected by Google Analytics. You can find all of these reports <a href="/transparency">here</a>. We
    also include information about donations, advertising reports, and server costs, as well as technical reports and other information.</p>
    <p>Additionally, our advertisers may gather some information about you in order to present more relevant ads to you. We cannot
    influence how our advertisers gather your data. However, we do allow you to opt-out of advertising entirely (though we appreciate
    a small <a href="/donate">donation</a> to make up for it). You can <a id ="alink" href="javascript:adOptOut();">click here</a> to
    opt-out of advertising entirely. This will disable ads, but only for that computer. If you use the site from your phone, your laptop,
    or anywhere else, you will have to disable ads from there as well.</p>
    <p>To further protect your privacy, your connection to mediacru.sh is done over SSL - this means that no one can snoop on your
    connection. This can be compromised by malicious software on your computer, however, and you should do frequent security audits
    on your computer if you are worried about this.</p>
    <h2>Removing Content</h2>
    <p>If you are able to prove that you are the copyright holder of some content on our site, and you would like it removed, please
    <a href="mailto:copyright@mediacru.sh">email us</a>. We will also respond to individually-prepared DMCA notices.</p>
    <p>In other situations, however, we will not remove content. You may contact us for more serious concerns on a case-by-case basis,
    but do not expect us to remove any content on our site that is not in violation of our terms. Though we will not often excercise
    this right, we reserve the right remove any content, at any time, without explanation.</p>
    <p>That being said, you are able to delete files from the same computer you uploaded them on. We don't store your IP, but given your
    IP again later, we can tell if a file belongs to you. Head to the page your media is on, and click "Delete" on the bottom of
    the page.</p>
    <h2>Contacting Us Securely</h2>
    <p>If you wish to encrypt your emails to us, use our public key and email <a href="mailto:secure@mediacru.sh">secure@mediacru.sh</a>:</p>
